# better-friends-list

Discord's friends list UI is hard to use when you have a lot of friends, so I took matters into my own hands.

## features

## planned features

- filtering by more than online/offline
- better sorting (multiple sort options?)
- better nicknaming
- friend folders?
- tagging system
- more compact UI
